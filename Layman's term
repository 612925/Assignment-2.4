Hadoop is an open source java framework that allows the storage and processing of large collection of data.
Hadoop consists of the following:
HDFS:
Hadoop distributed file system is the storage system of hadoop. It stores data in
distributed manner on commodity hardwares that interact with the master node to store data in blocks/perform tasks.
The master node is called NameNode and the slave node is called DataNode. Datanode sends hearbeats to the masternode(NameNode).

MapReduce
Map/Reduce algorithm consists of map and reduce that is used to process humungus amounts of data to generate patterns.
It too works on master slave architecture.The master node is called Resource Manager and the slave nodes are called the manager nodes
that are commodity machines used to process data.
